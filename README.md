- **Accounts**: Contains company details such as name, industry sector, and location  
- **Products**: Includes product names, categories, and pricing details  
- **Sales Pipeline**: Records of individual deals including deal stage, close date, revenue value, and assigned sales agent  
- **Sales Teams**: Information about sales agents, their reporting managers, and associated regional offices
